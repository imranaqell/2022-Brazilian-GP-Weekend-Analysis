Damp conditions during qualifying were an indicator that the session was about to be one of the most exciting of all time. As a Formula 1 fan, it was indeed very entertaining as Kevin Magnussen became the 106th different polesitter. He managed to snatch the pole away from Verstappen by two tenths. Here are the key points from qualifying:

1. The polesitter's teammate, Mick Schumacher, became a victim of a strategy blunder as he was last during qualifying.

2. Kevin Magnussen made no mistakes during his qualifying lap.

3. Ferrari once again made a strategy blunder.

4. Russell beached his W13 in the gravel during qualifying but did not damage his car.

[**Sprint**](https://github.com/imranaqell/2022-Brazilian-GP-Weekend-Analysis/tree/main/Sprint)

George Russell won the Brazilian Grand Prix Sprint Race after he ended up in the gravel yesterday! It was his first ever sprint race win, which awards him a front row for the Sunday race. Lewis Hamilton, who finished third, was promoted to the second spot on the grid due to Carlos Sainz changing a part of his engine, which awarded him a five-place grid penalty. Here are the key points from the sprint race:

1. Max Verstappen picked up some damage early in the race and lost his endplate to Carlos Sainz, which made his pace the most inconsistent.

2. Lewis Hamilton was the one with the strongest median pace.

3. During the 24 laps, the soft tyres degraded significantly.

4. The Red Bull has a massive straight-line speed advantage; even the Mercedes with DRS could not overtake the RB18.

[**Race**](https://github.com/imranaqell/2022-Brazilian-GP-Weekend-Analysis/tree/main/Race)

What a weekend it is for George Russell, who won the 2022 Brazilian Grand Prix. It was his first victory, made even sweeter by the fact that his teammate, Lewis Hamilton, finished second after passing nearly the entire grid. It was Mercedes' first win of the season and also its first 1-2 after quite some time. What a turnaround from themâ€”from being 1 second off the pace to winning a race!

Here are the key points from the race:

1. Lewis had a stronger median pace, but Russell had a more consistent pace due to being in clean air.

2. Ferrari was strong in this race but was not as strong as the mighty Mercedes.

3. Red Bull fumbled as the whole team had to face a disappointing weekend after a weak result for the team.

4. Both Alpines managed to score points after quite a disastrous sprint race on Saturday.
