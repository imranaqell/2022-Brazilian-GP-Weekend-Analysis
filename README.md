Damp conditions during qualifying were an indicator that the session was about to be one of the most exciting of all time. As a Formula 1 fan, it was indeed very entertaining as Kevin Magnussen became the 106th different polesitter. He managed to snatch the pole away from Verstappen by two tenths. Here are the key points from qualifying:

1. The polesitter's teammate, Mick Schumacher, became a victim of a strategy blunder as he was last during qualifying.

2. Kevin Magnussen made no mistakes during his qualifying lap.

3. Ferrari once again made a strategy blunder.

4. Russell beached his W13 in the gravel during qualifying but did not damage his car.

[**Sprint**](https://github.com/imranaqell/2022-Brazilian-GP-Weekend-Analysis/tree/main/Sprint)

George Russell won the Brazilian Grand Prix Sprint Race after he ended up in the gravel yesterday! It was his first ever sprint race win, which awards him a front row for the Sunday race. Lewis Hamilton, who finished third, was promoted to the second spot on the grid due to Carlos Sainz changing a part of his engine, which awarded him a five-place grid penalty. Here are the key points from the sprint race:

1. Max Verstappen picked up some damage early in the race and lost his endplate to Carlos Sainz, which made his pace the most inconsistent.

2. Lewis Hamilton was the one with the strongest median pace.

3. During the 24 laps, the soft tyres degraded significantly.

4. The Red Bull has a massive straight-line speed advantage; even the Mercedes with DRS could not overtake the RB18.
